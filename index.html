			<h2>Short biography</h2>
			<p>
				Hello there! You've stumbled across my webpage, welcome in. My name is
				Nellie, and I just turned 28. I left my job in the charity sector in
				August 2023, after having spent several years managing volunteers and
				also dipping my toe into the CMS our charity's web team used. I'm
				autistic and have quite black and white thinking, and I also enjoy
				creative things, so I think a career in coding might work for me! I've included some information about me below, but if you'd like any further information then please do check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellie-allsop/">my LinkedIn</a>
